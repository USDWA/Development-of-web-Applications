                      Explanation of files:

1- homepage.html: This is the homepage, it has links to photos,
   rooms (displaying 3 types), location which displays the location
   of the hotel, check in, check out, contact, about, and home if a 
   user wishes to go back to the homepage.

2- location.html: Displays the location of the hotel via Google Maps.

3- formpage.html: This file has the personal details and booking
   details. The personal details consist of first name, last name
   ID, email, and phone number.

   The first and last name must have at least 3 letters. The ID
   consists of numbers from 0 to 9 and should be 2 digits long.
   The phone number must have 10 digits. We chose a maximum number
   of rooms of 30. When the customer is done entering data and clicks
   on submit, the data is sent to register.php.

4- register.php requires(calls) init.php, which establishes a connec-
   tion with the database. Then it stores the first name, last name,
   ID, email, and phone number into variables. Then there's a query
   to select the next guest ID, and a query is executed to store 
   the first name, last name, ID, email, phone number, and guest ID
   into the database. Also there's a variable to store the book in
   date, book out date, number of rooms, number of adults, number
   of children, meals choice, and balcony choice.

5- init.php: Establishes a connection to the database.

6- precheckout.html: Asks the user for their first name and last name,
   the data is sent to checkout.php.

7- checkout.html: This is the check out form.
   It requires the first name, last name, and phone number to
   check out. When the user submits, the data is sent to checkout.php.

8- checkout.php: This is the payment form. It requires payment 
   by credit card asking for the card type, name on card, card number,
   check out date, and security code of the card. When the user submits
   the information, the data is sent to deleteguest.php.

9- deleteguest.php: The information related to the guest is deleted from
   the database.
